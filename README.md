* ML Algorithms and NN solutions for Kaggle*
Welcome to the my Kaggle ! This is a showcase for my experiments to comprehend better how the neural network architecture by creating models for Kaggle competitions.

📂 What's in This Repository?
This repository contains:

Neural Network Architectures: A variety of deep learning models tailored for different Kaggle datasets and tasks, including classification, regression, and more.
Preprocessing Pipelines: Step-by-step workflows for data cleaning, feature engineering, and preparing datasets for neural networks.
Experiment Logs: Details about model performances, hyperparameter tuning, and challenges faced.
Code & Notebooks: Reproducible Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) for each project, complete with explanations and visualizations.
Insights & Learnings: Reflections on what worked, what didn’t, and how I improved my models over time.

🏆 Featured Projects
